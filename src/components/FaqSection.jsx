Therefore, any changes or additions to the team must be passed by a governance vote from the community.

While most crash games pay 50% of revenue to investors in the house pool and keep back 50% for the site owners, with PINT you are the “owners” of WenRug. User fees from the game are paid out to PINT stakers. Holders will be able to stake their PINT to earn a voice in the community governance process, and direct use of funds of the Community Wallet towards PINT buybacks or additional development–all the while earning revenue from WenRug and more.' },

New supply will be hardcapped at a max supply of 10,000,000 tokens at which point PINT will become fully deflationary.' },
